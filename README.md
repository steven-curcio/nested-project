# Nested Project Outline

I will be migrating my friend's business website to AWS and incorporating some new features.

Current website:

<https://magsolutions-usa.com/>

## Infrastructure

As of now, the website is in a static state.  The easiest and most cost effective
way to migrate would be to make use of S3 to host the website.
